# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Quick guide:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch per feature/bug: `feature/xxx` or `fix/xxx`.
2. Run linters and tests before opening a PR.
3. Write clear PR descriptions and link related issues.
4. Use conventional commit messages.

For maintainers: enable branch protection and require CI checks on `master`/`main`.
